 Access Control So&hellip; what is access control?
Have you ever seen any type of button in any kind of platform that simply was greyed out because you didn&rsquo;t have permission to use it?
Well, that&rsquo;s due to the access controls.
They control who has access to what&hellip; that&rsquo;s it!" />

<h1 id="access-control">Access Control</h1>
<p>So&hellip; what is access control?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen any type of button in any kind of platform that simply was greyed out because you didn&rsquo;t have permission to use it?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s due to the access controls.</p>
<p>They <em>control</em> who has <em>access</em> to what&hellip; that&rsquo;s it! Super hard right? x)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="lab-1-apprentice-level">Lab #1 (Apprentice level)</h2>
<p>Most websites are built pretty much in the same way for easier dev maintenance and to cope with all the shenanigans search engines (like Google, Bing,&hellip;) require to index the website data.</p>
<p>And in most cases the structure of privileged access looks like</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://website.com/admin
</code></pre><p>or has some info stored in the robots.txt file</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://website.com/robots.txt
</code></pre><p>In this lab&rsquo;s particular case you should see the robots.txt file ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="lab-2-apprentice-level">Lab #2 (Apprentice level)</h2>
<p>As the above practice became too popular, web developers became worried about security aspects of it (as they should) and began to try to conceal that information by setting up a less predictable URL.</p>
<p>Thing is that most of devs think hackers can&rsquo;t code xD</p>
<p>So the solution many times passed by constructing the webpage info based on the user with scripts inside the webpage itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case of this lab. You should see in the middle of a JavaScript <!-- raw HTML omitted --> the amin page you want.</p>
