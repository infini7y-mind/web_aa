      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked music!
Can&amp;rsquo;t remember when it all started but my path took wings when my parents got me a cheap guitar and I just spent my time trying things&amp;hellip; not as hard as I would like nowadays but hey&amp;hellip; we can&amp;rsquo;t all be Jacobs right? :p
Path  2004 - Self learned acoustic guitar 2004 - Played in the boy scouts and in catholic church 2008 - Joined a university band called anTUNiA as guitarist and percussionist  https://www.</description>
